# Types of Design Patterns:-

* ### Factory Design Pattern:
     The MovieFactory class can be used to create different types of movies, such as ActionMovie, ComedyMovie, and DramaMovie.
* ### Observer Design Pattern:
     The BookMyShow class can be used to observe changes in the Movie class. For example, if a new movie is added, the BookMyShow class can be notified so that 
     it can update its database.
* ### Strategy Design Pattern: 
     The PaymentStrategy interface can be used to define different payment methods, such as CreditCardPayment, DebitCardPayment, and CashPayment.
* ### Singleton Design Pattern:
     In Book My Show, an example of the Singleton Pattern can be the use of a "TicketBookingManager" class. This class manages the booking process, handles seat 
     availability, and ensures that only one instance of the TicketBookingManager is used throughout the application.
